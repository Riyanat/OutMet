# OutMet
OutMet is a metric for prioritising intrusion alerts using correlation and outlier analysis. Given a set of intrusion alerts, OutMet assigns an outlier value to each alert which can be used to indicate how high or low an alert should be prioritised. First, alerts are grouped into meta-alerts using the correlation component. Next, the prioritisation component computes the outlier degree of each meta-alert.

The Demo.java class demos how OutMet works.
